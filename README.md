# Art @ Home
Welcome to my repository. Here you can find my art app called **Art @ Home**. The concept is that the user can view art from the Rijksmuseum on their preferred device.

## User story
As an art lover, I want to be able to search and view art from the Rijksmuseum at home, so that I can still enjoy art during a lockdown.

## API
For this project, I'm using the Rijksdata API. To start using the data and images, you need to obtain an API key by registering for a Rijksstudio account. You will be given a key instantly upon request, which you can find at the advanced settings of your Rijksstudio account.

## Any issues?
You can create an issue in this repository and let me know what's wrong.
